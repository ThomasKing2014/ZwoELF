class R_type:
	'''
	R_386_GOT32 	This relocation type computes the distance from the
		base of the global offset
		table to the symbol's global offset table entry.
		It additionally instructs the link
		editor to build a global offset table.

	R_386_PLT32 	This relocation type computes the address of the
		symbol's procedure linkage
		table entry and additionally instructs the link editor to
		build a procedure linkage table.

	R_386_COPY 		The link editor creates this relocation type for
		dynamic linking. Its offset
		member refers to a location in a writable segment.
		The symbol table index specifies a symbol that should exist
		both in the current object file and in a shared
		object. During execution, the dynamic linker copies data
		associated with the shared object's symbol to the location
		specified by the offset.

	R_386_GLOB_DAT 	This relocation type is used to set a global offset
		table entry to the address of the specified symbol. The
		special relocation type allows one to determine the
		correspondence between symbols and global offset table entries.

	R_3862_JMP_SLOT The link editor creates this relocation type for
		dynamic linking. Its offset member gives the location of a
		procedure linkage table entry. The dynamic linker modifies
		the procedure linkage table entry to transfer control to the
		designated symbol's address.

	R_386_RELATIVE 	The link editor creates this relocation type for
		dynamic linking. Its offset member gives a location within a
		shared object that contains a value representing a relative address.
		The dynamic linker computes the corresponding virtual
		address by adding the virtual address at which the shared object
		was loaded to the relative address. Relocation entries for this
		type must specify 0 for the symbol table index.

	R_386_GOTOFF 	This relocation type computes the difference between a
		symbol's value and the address of the global offset table. It
		additionally instructs the link editor to build the global
		offset table.

	R_386_GOTPC 	This relocation type resembles R_386_PC32, except it uses
		the address of the global offset table in its calculation.
		The symbol referenced in this relocation
		normally is _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_, which additionally instructs
		the link editor to build the global offset table.
