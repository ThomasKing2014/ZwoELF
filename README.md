ElfParserLib
============

An ELF parsing and manipulation library for Python

This library works (just now) only with x86 ELF binaries. It was written as a parser library to understand the ELF format and gained some manipulation functions after a while.

It is not finished yet (due to time problems) nor the manipulation in any state of reliable use.


How to use it
============

I added some examples in the directory "examples" that will show how the library can be used.
